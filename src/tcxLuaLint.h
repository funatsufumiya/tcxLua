// tcxLuaLint — static "undefined global" lint for Lua chunks.
//
// Lua itself has no compile-time check for undefined variables: reading an
// unknown name silently yields nil at runtime. For live-coding hosts
// (TrussSketch hot reload, exampleLiveUpdate, ...) that is a poor experience —
// a typo'd name only surfaces as a nil-arithmetic error mid-frame, if at all.
//
// This lint compiles (WITHOUT running) each chunk and scans the resulting
// bytecode: every global read (GETTABUP _ENV "name") whose name is neither
// assigned anywhere in the given chunks (SETTABUP _ENV) nor already present
// in the state's globals is reported with its chunk name and line.
//
// Notes:
//  * Plain Lua 5.4 only. With LuaJIT (TCXLUA_USE_LUAJIT) the bytecode format
//    differs, so the lint is a no-op that reports no issues.
//  * Dynamic global access (_G["x"], rawset) is invisible to the scan; a read
//    of such a name is a false positive. Escape hatch: assign the name once
//    (even `name = nil` counts as a definition).
